# 100 Days of Swift (UIKit)

## Description

This repository contains a lot of projects from 100 days of swift course by Paul Hudson.\
Some of the projects in the course were outdated and impossible to recreate without changing the whole structure of the project.\
Other projects were games, which I didn't do all, because I know Unity and C#, so, why would I do simplier games using SpriteKit and Swift?
